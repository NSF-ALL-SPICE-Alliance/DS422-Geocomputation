## 🌍 Course Overview  
**DS 422: Geocomputation** is the third course in the GIS Certificate Program, following Cartographic Design and leading into advanced spatial methods and capstone work.  

This course focuses on the **computational handling of geographic data**, emphasizing reproducible workflows, vector and raster computation, and integration of APIs and open datasets. Students will gain hands-on experience with tools including **R, sf, terra, stars, osmdata, tidycensus, and mapgl** while working through case studies such as:  

- 🌊 Tsunami evacuation zones and population exposure  
- 🚗 Traffic analysis during Hawaiʻi tsunami evacuation  
- 📊 Oʻahu socioeconomic indicators (ACS computation)  
- 🏪 Business location analytics on Oʻahu  
- 🛡️ Defense & DoD-related geocomputation
