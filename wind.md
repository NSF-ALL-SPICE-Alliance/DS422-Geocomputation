How can we can we use our current GIS skills to determine the most suitable areas for wind energy production?

Datasets we would need?
[Wind data] (https://opendata.hawaii.gov/dataset/wind-speed-100m)
[Current Wind energy production](https://energy.usgs.gov/uswtdb/data/)
Where wind energy production is prohibited (designated cultural land, areas prone to wildfires, residential neighborhoods, habitats environmental conservaitn land)
[Zoning Areas] (https://geoportal.hawaii.gov/datasets/zoning-city-and-county-of-honolulu/explore?location=21.315399%2C-158.050483%2C13.65)
Residential Areas
